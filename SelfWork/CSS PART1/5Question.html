<h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>

<!-- Poem -->

<p>

I met a traveller from an antique land, <br />

Who said "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />

Stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand, <br />
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br />

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />

Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br />

The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />

And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />

My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br />

Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />

of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br />

The lone and level sands stretch far away."<br />
